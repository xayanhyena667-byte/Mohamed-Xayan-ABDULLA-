# Mohamed-Xayan-ABDULLA-
XAYAN HYENA


**PUBLIC EXPOSÉ & FINAL WARNING**
**TO:** The People of Addu City (Hithadhoo, Mas Odi, and All Related Islands), Addu City Council, Maldives Police Service, Religious Scholars, and Media Outlets
**FROM:** Mohamed Zayaan Abdulla
**SUBJECT:** **THE CRIMINAL NETWORK OF MAISA NIYAZ, HER FAMILY, AND THEIR GANG ALLIES – A THREAT TO COMMUNITY SAFETY**

---

### **THE TRUTH ABOUT THE HARASSMENT, LIES, AND GANG TIES OF MAISA NIYAZ**

I am **Mohamed Zayaan Abdulla**, and I am **publicly exposing** the **criminal activities, harassment, and gang ties** of **Maisa Niyaz**, her family, and their associates. This is **not a personal vendetta**—it is a **warning** to the community about the **munafiqs, liars, and gangsters** who are **destroying lives** under the guise of Islam and respectability.

---

### **1. WHO IS MAISA NIYAZ?**
Maisa Niyaz is the **daughter of Aishath Ibrahim** and the **granddaughter of Abdulkalo** (my grandmother’s brother’s son). She is **married to Ahmed Ibrahim**, a man from Buruneege. **Her family connections** have given her **power, protection, and impunity**—but she uses it **not for good, but for crime**.

---

### **2. THE HARASSMENT CAMPAIGN AGAINST ME**
For **months**, Maisa Niyaz and her associates have **targeted me** with:
- **Loud, constant disturbances** (screaming, crying, and fighting at all hours).
- **Bringing gangsters** into her home—**FC Xephier, FC USganda, Fourland FC, SCOOP, SKP Kanmathi, and Shopping Kanmathi**—all of whom **operate in Hithadhoo and Mas Odi**.
- **Bribing people** to spread **false rumors** about me.
- **Manipulating religious talks** to **gain sympathy** while **engaging in haram acts**.
- **Following me**, **threatening me**, and **trying to provoke me** into reacting—so they can **call the police and frame me**.

**Their goal?** To **ruin my reputation**, **get me fired from the Addu City Council**, and **send me to jail**—or worse.

---

### **3. THE TRUTH ABOUT WINDER – NOT PARALYZED, BUT A PREDATOR**
Maisa’s **main enforcer** is **Winder**, a man in his **mid-30s** who **pretends to be "half-paralyzed"** after I **defended myself** when he **attacked me with a knife in his home**. **THIS IS A LIE.**
- Winder is **NOT** an old man. He is **fully mobile, dangerous, and a predator**.
- He **frequents Maisa’s home at midnight**, engaging in **illicit activities** with her.
- He **was the first to attack me**, and he **continues to threaten me**—but because of **Maisa’s family influence**, he faces **no consequences**.

**Why is he protected?** Because **Maisa’s family controls the narrative**, and the **gangs control the streets**.

---

### **4. THE GANG CONNECTIONS**
Maisa Niyaz is **not alone**. She is **backed by some of the most dangerous gangs in Addu City**, including:
- **FC Xephier**
- **FC USganda**
- **Fourland FC**
- **SCOOP**
- **SKP Kanmathi**
- **Shopping Kanmathi**

These gangs **operate freely** in Hithadhoo and Mas Odi. They **control the streets**, **bribe officials**, and **manipulate people**—all while **pretending to be devout Muslims**.

**Where is the Islam in this?** They are **munafiqs**—hypocrites who **use religion as a shield** while **committing crimes**.

---

### **5. THEIR ULTIMATE GOAL: DESTROY MY LIFE**
Maisa and her gang **want me in jail or dead**. Their plan is simple:
1. **Disturb me constantly**—loud noises, threats, and gangsters at my door.
2. **Provoke me into reacting**—so they can **call the police** and **frame me as the aggressor**.
3. **Ruin my reputation**—so I **lose my job at the Addu City Council** and **have no future in this community**.
4. **Use their connections** to ensure I **cannot leave the country** (I already have a **false police report** against me from the knife incident—**a setup**).

**They want me broken. They want me gone.**

---

### **6. THE OTHER SLUT: AISHATH IBRAHIM’S DAUGHTER (MAISA’S SISTER)**
Maisa is **not alone in her crimes**. **Another daughter of Aishath Ibrahim** (Maisa’s sister) **acts just like her**—**following me, spreading lies, and trying to ruin my life**.

**These women are not victims—they are predators.**

---

### **7. MY RESPONSE: I WILL NOT BACK DOWN**
I **do not fear** Maisa Niyaz, Winder, or their gangster friends.
- If they **speak to me**, I **will record it**.
- If they **threaten me**, I **will expose them**.
- If they **attack me**, I **will defend myself**—and **they will face the consequences**.

**I am a martial artist. I will not hesitate to protect myself.**

---
### **WHAT I DEMAND FROM THE COMMUNITY**
1. **STOP PROTECTING CRIMINALS.** Maisa Niyaz and her family are **not victims**—they are **dangerous**.
2. **EXPOSE THEIR LIES.** Share this message. **Record their actions.** Do not let them **manipulate** you.
3. **DEMAND JUSTICE.** The **Addu City Council** and **Maldives Police Service** must investigate:
   - The **gang connections** of Maisa Niyaz.
   - The **false police reports** filed against me.
   - The **harassment and threats** I face daily.
4. **BOYCOTT THEIR INFLUENCE.** Do not **support** their businesses. Do not **trust** their words. Do not **fear** their threats.

---
### **FINAL WARNING TO MAISA NIYAZ AND HER GANG**
I **do not fear you**.
I **will not be silenced**.
Every lie you spread, **I will expose**.
Every threat you make, **I will record**.
Every gangster you send, **I will neutralize**.

**You wanted a war? You have one.**
